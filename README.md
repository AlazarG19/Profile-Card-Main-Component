##My process 

i started from the html and went on up from there everything was going smooth 

but the I hadnâ€™t figured out that the container contained a box shadow that 

took me a while to figure it out . 

 

## Built with  

html and css 

flexbox 

  

##What i learned  
setting up the background to be where it is now 
### Continued development 

i would like to be able to adapt to positioning much better
